Portfolio work for 94-870 Telling Stories with Data

# About Me
Hello, my name is Nolan (he/him) and I am a first year MSPPM DA student. I have been living in Pittsburgh for a while now, having completed my BS at the University of Pittsburgh in Economics and Political Science. My background is primarily in university and think tank research and I am hoping to use this course to better present the data that I work with. After graduating I hope to continue with a think tank style organization or work with a federal agency on program evaluation and audit.

# I hope to learn..
I hope to learn how to more effectively communicate with the data I use on a daily basis! I am currently working with survey data and am hoping to impress my coworkers with some high quality visuals.

While the graph has alot of extra elements that could be removed with more time with the flourish tool, the graph shows that overtime Japan has significantly increased their debt to GDP ratio compared to other OECD countries. This comparison is also shown with the difference between Japan and the average ratio line that is overlayed in black on the scatterplot.
