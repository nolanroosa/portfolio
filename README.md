Portfolio work for 94-870 [Telling Stories with Data](https://api.heinz.cmu.edu/courses_api/course_detail/94-870/)


# About Me
Hello, my name is [Nolan (he/him)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nolanroosa/) and I am a first year MSPPM DA student. I have been living in Pittsburgh for a while now, having completed my BS at the University of Pittsburgh in Economics and Political Science. My background is primarily in university and think tank research and I am hoping to use this course to better present the data that I work with. After graduating I hope to continue with a think tank style organization or work with a federal agency on program evaluation and audit.

# I hope to learn..
I hope to learn how to more effectively communicate with the data I use on a daily basis! I am currently working with survey data and am hoping to impress my coworkers with some high quality visuals.
