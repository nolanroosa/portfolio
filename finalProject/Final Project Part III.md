# Final Write-Up

Through this class I tried to tell the story of non voters. Often written off as lazy, or uninterested, I wanted to share their story in way
that would elicit sympathy from the audience. I knew if I could show that there are structural barriers to voting, that people would be
more likely to sympathize with a non-voter.

I used alot of R analysis to get my initial understanding of the data. I eventually built out the bar chart with 95% confidence intervals
using the ggplot2 and plotly libraries. While the graphic is interactive in R studio, there was no way to embed R code, or set up an html code,
so the image presents as static in the presentation.

I had to create my own data set for the tableau dashboard. Using this [data](https://www.city-data.com/zipmaps/Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania.html) I
was able to find the estimated popualtions by zip code in 2019 for Pittsburgh along with the adjusted gross income based on tax filings. I combined
this by hand in excel with [safegraph](https://www.safegraph.com/2020-polling-location-data) data on zip codes per zip code. From there it was
a simple upload to tableau, posted to tableau publish, and used embed code to add to my shorthand.

From user feedback I learned that I needed to keep my visuals simple for people to understand my story. The people I spoke with all are pursuing
graduate degrees and each had unique comments on how I should display my visuals to make them more digestable. I changed by y axis on the bar graphs
to accomodate for this, I added a second bar graph to make my point more clear, and I used tabs in tableau to make it easier for the user to
click back and forth and easily recognize the patterns. I also added more transitional content to lead the user along the story more smoothly

# Pain Points

I was originally interested in analyzing this issue from a perspective of race, not income, but it was really hard to find racial density data
per zip code. The one data set I was able to find only looked at the city of Atlanta, and my polling place data excluded the state of Georgia. 
This was a frustrating pain point and resulted in me switching to an income based perspective. I was hesitant about this approach due to the
confounding nature of the impact of high income on polling places through increases in income tax that a zip code could potentially use for
election services.

Another pain point was implementing tableau into the shorthand presentation. I initially tried to use the HTML from tableau public to embed in
the shorthand presentation, but was left with a weird cropped image and was not able to rescale. I was able to use embedded code from tableau but
this may require the user to have a tableau public account, which limits my audience drastically.
