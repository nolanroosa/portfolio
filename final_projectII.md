# Storyboard and Wireframe:
https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/from-people-to-voters/index.html

I used shorthand to create a rough storyboard and included my wireframed images. They include R and Tableau output.



# Below is the user feedback I recieved on this storyboard and the wireframes:

Target: People who experience frustration with people who do not vote.
Approach: Ensuring that I speak with people who have differing political views, and are representative in age and gender.

## INTERVIEW 1
What is your name, gender identity, political affiliation?

D, Man, 23, Democrat

What did you think about the wireframe visualizations?
What would you change?

A valuable add would be to show that across race, people care about voting equally, put this side by side with the graph showing. 
CHange the maps so they overlay over each other, that way it's easier to remember and compare.

What did you like
What did you think of the order of the storyboard/wireframe?
What would you change?

Nothing of mention, thought that the layout was simple and conducive to the argument.

What did you like?
Do you think the presentation has a strong call to action?
Would you change it?

Provide an example for the call to action of how people can be impactful. THen tell them that they can do it. Show and then tell

What possible action resonated most strongly?

National holiday, volunteer voting accessibility, call representatives

Do you feel like you sympathize more with voters after this presentation?
Why or Why not

Remind of the scale of the issue before could help keep me more interested.






## INTERVIEW 2

What is your name, gender identity, political affiliation?

A, Man, 24, Republican

What did you think about the wireframe visualizations?
What would you change?

I thought they did a nice job conveying your points. Make sure that apathy is included in why people are not voting, 
that could be a big reason that is not explicitly stated in the list of reasons

maybe put polling places before perceived difficulties? Also works the way that you did it. 

What did you like?
Do you think the presentation has a strong call to action?
Would you change it?
What possible action resonated most strongly?
What else could I include?

If you wanted to be more radical; Compulsory voting. I liked how you showed ways that people themselves can be involved, but also more macro things they can do.
remind people to register to vote yourself and make sure that you're voting.


Do you feel like you sympathize more with voters after this presentation?
Why or Why not

I think you conveyed that there are other reasons people arent voting than being lazy and that does make me more understanding





## INTERVIEW 3
What is your name, gender identity, political affiliation?

M, Female, 22, Democrat

What did you think about the wireframe visualizations?
What would you change?

The bar graph Y axis is not intuitive. What do those values mean? What is the range?


What did you like
What did you think of the order of the storyboard/wireframe?
What would you change?

Websites have tabs so that you can see the different parts. TABS would prompt people nicely.

What did you like?
Do you think the presentation has a strong call to action?
Would you change it?
What possible action resonated most strongly?

No thoughts

Do you feel like you sympathize more with voters after this presentation?
Why or Why not

I think you did a good job holding on to that through the presentation.
There are multiple reasons that people can vote and that its inconvenient and they cant get there to vote.


# Actionable Changes
1. Add graph next to difficulty to show that demographic does not affect wanting to vote
2. Overlay maps
3. Add scrolling tabs
4. Make Y axis more intuitive on difficulty graph
5. Transition from map to call to action with a example of something that can be done
