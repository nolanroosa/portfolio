# Final Project Part I

Following an election cycle it is easy to buy into the trope that a large number of Americans don't vote. In the 2020 Presidential election 62% of Americans would not cast a ballot. This was high turnout, but the United States still lags behind comperable countries when it comes to voter turnout. The story that I am interested in telling is the different reasons that people choose to not vote. I am curious how people of different backgrounds interact with, or dont interact with, elections.

# Outline
Reader enters with some frustration towards people who dont vote....'I can do it why cant they?!'

1. Who is not voting: introduce our characters
3. Why are groups x,y,z not voting: our characters have alot going on!
4. Is voting more challenging for different groups: AH HA moment of compassion
5. How do we address this currently? Is it adequate in addressing the issues we just exposed?: Call to action

# The Data
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/non-voters
The data set I will use is one created by FiveThiryEight. The poll was conducted on a sample designed to be representative of America, and was collected during September of 2020. The data consists of 5,239 respondents and 119 columns of data. I plan to work with the data initially in R, testing different responses between groups. A few analyses I would like to start with are ranking of most popular reasons not to vote by race, income, and gender. I am also curious if there are differences between groups of percieved difficulty voting. After finding those that best tell the story of why people don't vote, I will move over into Tableau.

# Method and Medium
I really like the way that people have presented their work on shorthand. The way the pages scroll together seems like a nice way to tell the story. I hope to integrate some of the Tableau visualizations I create, along with maybe a video. I want to make sure that the medium highlights the human element of not voting. While a knee jerk reaction could be to be frustrated with people who do not vote, I want my viewer to walk away with a more compassionate response.
